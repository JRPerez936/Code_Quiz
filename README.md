# Code_Quiz

This is a website containing my quiz generator. It has been designed after the mockup shown as well as some of the challenges from the week 
and contains multiple functions. When you click the start function the questions show up and a timer counts down in the top right. 
each of the options listed below the questions are buttons that react with an "incorrect" or "correct" based on whats chosen. When you finish the quiz,
you are prompted to save your score by writing your initials and clicking the save button. When you do, you would ideally be taken to the
scores page where the scores would be listed, but that function hasnt been fully implemented yet.

</br> This is what the page looks like </br>
